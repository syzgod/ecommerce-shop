# ecommerce-shop

This is my biggest project which includes many technologies but mainly React JS, Sass for styling and Firebase for Authorization and backend management.

The website is in an early stage just to showcase how it might function in the future.

There are many things missing, WIP or partially implemented:

- Login is partially working but disabled at the moment. Not required for anything.
- Registration is WIP
- Pagination will be added later on
- Subscribe component and an image carousel as an advertisement component are on the way
- Footer will be most likely filled with dummy data
- AI might be integrated as a Chat component (for fun :))
- Definitely some Dashboard will be added for Admin role to manage the website
- Stripe will be added to simulate the payment
- Of course a shopping cart will be added very soon
- Most likely will get a better UI and UX in general (I'm contantly learning and changing my mind)
- Might move the whole project to Next.js, this is not decided yet as I'm just in the process of getting to know Next.js

The project is mostly up to my and others imagination. The potential is there but a lot of work needs to be done. And going to be done.
