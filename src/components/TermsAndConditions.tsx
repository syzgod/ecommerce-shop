      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>
            These terms and conditions govern the contractual relationship
            between the customer and the seller in connection with all products
            offered in the online shop. The customer acknowledges these terms
            and conditions when placing an order.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Conclusion of contract</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The presentation of products in the online shop does not constitute
            a binding offer by the seller. By clicking the "Buy Now" button, the
            customer places a binding order for the products in the shopping
            cart. The seller confirms receipt of the order by email. The
            contract is concluded when the seller sends a confirmation of
            acceptance to the customer by email.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Payment</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The prices quoted in the online shop are final prices including VAT.
            Payment can be made by credit card, PayPal, or other payment methods
            offered in the online shop. The seller reserves the right to exclude
            certain payment methods for individual orders.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Delivery</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The seller delivers to the delivery address specified by the
            customer. The delivery time depends on the availability of the
            products and the shipping method selected by the customer. The
            seller will inform the customer of the expected delivery time in the
            order confirmation. If the delivery time is exceeded, the customer
            has the right to withdraw from the contract.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Right of withdrawal</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The customer has the right to withdraw from the contract within 14
            days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period begins on the
            day on which the customer or a third party designated by the
            customer, who is not the carrier, takes possession of the goods. To
            exercise the right of withdrawal, the customer must inform the
            seller by means of a clear statement. The customer may use the model
            withdrawal form provided by the seller for this purpose, but this is
            not mandatory.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Warranty</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The statutory warranty rights apply to all products offered in the
            online shop. If the delivered goods are defective, the customer has
            the right to demand subsequent performance, i.e. either repair or
            replacement. If subsequent performance fails, the customer has the
            right to withdraw from the contract or to reduce the purchase price.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Liability</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The seller is liable for damages caused by intent or gross
            negligence. In case of slight negligence, the seller is liable only
            if an obligation is violated, the fulfillment of which is essential
            for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the
            customer can regularly rely.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Data protection</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The seller collects and uses the personal data of the customer in
            accordance with the applicable data protection regulations. The data
            protection declaration of the seller, which can be accessed on the
            website, provides further information.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Applicable law and jurisdiction</h2>{' '}
          <p>
            The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies to all legal
            relationships between the seller and the customer. The exclusive
            place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection
            with the contract is the registered office of the seller, provided
            that the customer is a merchant or a legal entity under public law.
